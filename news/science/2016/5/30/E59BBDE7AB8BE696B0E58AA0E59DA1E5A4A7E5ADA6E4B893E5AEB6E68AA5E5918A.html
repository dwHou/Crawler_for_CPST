        报告简介：
       </strong>
       Efficient and extensive harvesting of solar energy is essential to resolving energy and environmental crises. Besides photovoltaics, photocatalysis is a potentially important means of harvesting solar energy. In photocatalysis, sunlight is absorbed by semiconductors to generate hot electrons and holes, subsequently they drive desirable uphill chemical reactions such as water splitting and CO

       conversion to useful hydrocarbons. The efficiency of semiconductor photocatalysts, however, is severely limited by their weak trapping power for sunlight. Au and Ag nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit strong localized surface plasmon resonance effect, leading to light trapping power much greater than semiconductor nanomaterials. Integrating plasmonic NPs with semiconductors has been proposed to significantly improve the efficiency of semiconductor photocatalysts. I will briefly review the fundamental physical and chemical processes important to the function of plasmonic hybrid photocatalysts, and address some key physical and material issues that need to be resolved in order to realize practical photocatalysts for large-scale applications.

        报告简介：
       </b>
       Nonlinear optics was born in 1961, only one year after the laser invention. Since then, nonlinear optical phenomena have found a wide range of applications. To realize viable technological applications, materials with efficient nonlinear optical mechanisms are the key. Recent advances in two-dimensional materials (2DMs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have offered new types of materials. In this talk, we focus on their nonlinear optical responses when they are excited by processes of multiphoton absorption. As example [1, 2], we present our fundamental studies on two-photon absorption in graphene. In addition, we also present our observation of multiphoton absorption in 5-atomic-layer hexagonal Boron Nitride film [3]. Finally, we report both multiphoton-excited photoluminescence and third-harmonic generation from metal-organic frameworks [4, 5].
