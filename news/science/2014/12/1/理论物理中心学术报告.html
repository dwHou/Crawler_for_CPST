      摘要: One of the major goals in nuclear physics is to understand nuclear structure and reactions starting from realistic nuclear interactions. However, this is a big challenge for nuclear physicist due to the complexity of nuclear many-body calculations and the uncompleted understanding of nuclear forces. One of the successful nuclear many-body theories is the Monte Carlo shell model (MCSM), which reduces the dimension of model space dramatically by a stochastic method compared to the traditional shell model calculations. Meanwhile, the unitary correlation operator method (UCOM) was introduced to treat two main correlations in realistic nuclear interactions: central correlation and tensor correlation. In our work, for the first time, the MCSM and the UCOM is combined to investigate the structure of light nuclei from mass number A = 3 to 12. The ground state and the excited states is calculated in the MCSM in the model space emax = 3. It is found that the convergence of the MCSM calculation is obtained around the MCSM dimension 30. The spurious center-of-mass motion is treated with Lawson’s prescription. The total energy, electromagnetic moment, transition and occupation properties are discussed. Although the defect of present MCSM calculations appear due to the small model space, it can be noted that the MCSM might provide a possible method to  break the "bottle neck” of nuclear ab initio investigation.
